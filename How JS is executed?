There are 2 phases when we run the program:
  Memory reation Phase
    Whenever the variable i creted then it is marked as undefined and for function the while code is saved.
  Code
    The variables are assigned the value.
Functions:
  Function Invoction - See a function with paramters
  Functions are heart of JS. They behve very differently than any other language.
  When a new function is invoked then the new execution context is created.
  Phase 1 : The argument is already assigned the value but the variable is undefined.
  Phase 2 : The caluclations are performed and replace the value present in memory.
  Return keyword returns the control to the function where it was invoked.
  After that the whole execution context is deleted.
  
  
  CALL STACK -  This will manage the whole thing like when there are execution context wihtin one another.
    Managing execution context.
    Whenever new exectuion context is reated then added to the stack. and when over then pop.
    Other names - Execution Context Stack, Program Stack, COntorl Stack, Runtime Stack, Machine Stack.
