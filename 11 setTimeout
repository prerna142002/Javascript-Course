<script>
  var i = 1;
  setTimeout(function(){
    console.log(i);
   }, 1000);
}
x();
</script>

Will print the value after the time limit given in the funciton.\
The timer doesnot run on the program. Means it will not wait for 3000 miliseconds and then run the program.

<script>
  var i = 1;
  setTimeout(function(){
    console.log(i);
   }, 1000);
   console.log("Prerna");
}
x();
</script>

OUTPUT:
Prerna
1

Time, tide and javascript does not wait for anything.
The function will remember by making closure.
setTimeOut takes the callback fucntion and stores it somewhere else and attaches a timer to it.
Then goes in call stack when time is finished.
