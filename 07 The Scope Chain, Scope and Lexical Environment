<script>
  function a(){
    console.log(b);
   }
  var b = 10;
  a();
</script>

The b in function can access the b outside.

<script>
  function a(){
      c();
      function c(){
        console.log(b);
      }
   }
  var b = 10;
  a();
</script>

SCOPE = Where we can access a variable in a code.

Wherever the Global Execution is cretaed the Lexical environment is also created.
Lexical Environment = Local memory + Lexical Environment of its parent.
Lexical = Hierarchy/Order. Where the code is present physically inside the code.
c function is lexically inside a function. 
Whenever the memory space is created then lexical environment reference is also given.

Scope Chain is the reference chain of various lexical environment.
Anonymous = Global Execution Context.
