The variable is given as undefined in the memory execution phase.
 
 <script>
  var a;
  console.log(a);
  if(a == undfined) console.log("a is undefined");
  else console.log("a is not undefined");
 </script>
 
 Output => a is undefined
  
 <script>
  var a;
  a=10;
  if(a == undfined) console.log("a is undefined");
  else console.log("a is not undefined");
 </script>
 
 Output => a is not undefined
 
 JS is loosely/weakly typed language - don't attach to a particular data-type. ( we can add string/double/boolean according to our needs.)
 Stronger as manages Behind the Scenes and handles the complexity.
 
DONT do a=undefined; => Non-conventional way. Because this is reserved keyword meant to know whether variable was given a value.
