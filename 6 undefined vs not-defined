The variable is given as undefined in the memory execution phase.
 
 <script>
  var a;
  console.log(a);
  if(a == undfined) console.log("a is undefined");
  else console.log("a is not undefined");
 </script>
 
 Output => a is undefined
  
 <script>
  var a;
  a=10;
  if(a == undfined) console.log("a is undefined");
  else console.log("a is not undefined");
 </script>

 JS is loosely typed language - don't attach to a particular data-type. ( we can add string/double/boolean )
