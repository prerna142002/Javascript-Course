Accessign the values before the initializing like below:

<script>
getName();
console.log(x);

var x = 7;
function getName() {
  console.log("Javascript"):
}

</script>

Result in other languages - Error
Result in JS - 
Javascript
undefined.


This concept is Hoisting - Phenomena of accesing the elemenst before even we have intialized it and without nay error.

Difference between not-defined and udndefined:
not-defined - if value is not intilizaed but we are trying to access it. 

<script>
getName();
console.log(x);

var x = 7;
var getName() = () => {
  console.log("Javascript"):
} // This will now behave as a variable.

</script>
This will say that getName is not function.
