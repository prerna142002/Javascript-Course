Introduced in ES6.
let and const declarations = hoisted and in temporal dead zone for time being and behaves differently as compared to val.

<script>
  let a = 10; // This is also hoisted but cannot be accessed before initilization.
  var b = 10; // Can access the value in hoisting before code is executed.
</script>

REASON:
They are not in GLOBAL space but are declare in a diffent space.
TEMPORAL DEAD ZONE : Time since when the let variable was hoisted and till it is inializethe vlaue.
