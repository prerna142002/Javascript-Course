Functions are 1st class citizens.
CALLBACK FUNCTIONS:
When we add function in the function is known as the callback function.
It is powerful as it gives asynchronous world in the single threaded synchronous call.( can do one thing at a time and in order).
<script>
  funcion x(){
  
  }
  x(function y()){
  
  })
</script>


<script>
  setTimeout(funciton () {
    console.log("timer");
   }, 5000);
   
   function x(y){
      console.log("x");
    }
    x(fucnction y() {
      console.log("y");
     });
     
</script>

OUTPUT:
x
y
timer
